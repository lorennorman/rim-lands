Lore Primer
===========

The Core Cities are bustling and prosperous affairs with wealth and abundance.

But this is not The Core; this is The Rim Eternal.

The rim lands are populated only with the banished, the feeble, and the insane... and those who would hunt them.

Default Scenario
================

You were passengers on a rimbound transport this morning. Most people were forced to be here: either commanded by their employer, the Core Alliance, to drive this caravan into the Rim each week, or imprisoned by the CA and being dumped out here by the employees. But there are always a few strong wills -- following some divine purpose or other -- along for the ride.

Before arrival however, the caravan was hit by... well, none of you really know. But it must've been bad, because there are only 3 survivors and the remains are unrecognizable, both of people AND of wagons.

Trembling, you scour the wreckage for useful supplies and survey the terrain for means of shelter. Finally, looking to each other, you take stock of your relative strengths and set to work. You'll discover the weaknesses, in time.

From disaster springs hope! Your new life on the Rim begins now.
