Lore Primer
===========

The Core Cities are bustling and prosperous affairs with wealth and abundance.

This is not The Core; this is The Rim Eternal.

The rim lands are populated only with the banished, the feeble, and the insane... or those who would hunt them.

Default Scenario
================

You were passengers on a rimbound transport this morning. Most people had to be here: either employed by the Core Alliance to drive this caravan into the Rim each week, or imprisoned by the CA and being dumped out here. But there are always a few strong wills following some divine purpose or other along for the ride.

Before arrival however, the caravan was hit by... well, none of you really know. But it must've been bad, because there are only 3 survivors and the remains are unrecognizable, of the people AND the wagons.

Trembling, the survivors look to each other and take stock of each others relative skills and weaknesses, as well as the salvageable supplies in the wreckage and the surrounding landscape.

From disaster springs hope, as your new life on the Rim begins now.
