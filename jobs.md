What "small groups of pawns" get up to:
(small groups of pawns are 1 - 10)

Early Game
- early colony planning, design, very fun phase
  - "captivate them in this first impression and they'll think back upon its raw, innocent magic every time they start a new colony"
- building fundamental systems infrastructure
- running large farms easily
- defending large farms from "lots of littles"
- ranching interesting life forms (tamagachi?)
- weak vs The Core (tax collectors, military detachments, bounty hunters, basically use you as they wish)
- encountering Personalities for the first time with no Reputation (a clean sociopolitical slate) (storygen)

Late Game
- cultivating rare plants
- defending high-value buildings from "villain strikes" (Personalities + storygen)
- controlling the relationship with The Core: throwing them out violently or continuing service while negotiating an ever-more lucrative agreement
- encountering developed Personalities with whom you share a rich, eventful history, while trailing a vibrant diplomatic history of your own
- launch caravans causing pawns to permanently leave to start new settlements at strategic locations in the region (storygen)

What do "factions" get up to:
(factions are networks of small groups of pawns)
Building Out a Network
  - roads
  - other? (power? leylines? magic? voidfibers?)
  - connected resources at individual settlements are somehow net positive across the network
    - let them easily produce far too much to store, so a single farming colony produces LOTS of export, instantly freeing the next 10 pawns in new colonies from sustenance work
  - what is money [facepalm]
    - use money as the limiter gating on the tech tree and network build-out
    - they have to run successful businesses to make enough money to get ahead
    - "keeping pawns alive shall be easy, paying their wages, however..."
- accepting/completing "quest" scenarios which emerge on the map periodically (add nodes to the network automatically after completing a small challenge there) storygen
- penetrating into the Outer Rim'lyeh with well-stocked supply lines
