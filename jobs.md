What "small groups of pawns" get up to:
(small groups of pawns are 1 - 10)

Early Game
- early colony planning/design, very fun phase
  - "captivate them in this first impression and they'll think back upon its raw, innocent magic every time they start a new colony"
- setting up fundamental systems/infrastructure
- running large farms of basic food easily
- defending large farms from "lots of littles"
- ranching interesting life forms (Tamagochi?) (storygen)
- weak vs The Core (tax collectors, military detachments, bounty hunters, basically use your resources as they wish)
- encountering Personalities for the first time with no Reputation (a clean sociopolitical slate) (storygen)

Late Game
- cultivating rare plants (Forage/Harvest/Cultivate/Build)
- defending high-value buildings from "villain strikes" (Personalities + storygen)
- controlling the relationship with The Core:
  - throw them out violently, or...
  - continue servicing them while negotiating an ever-more-lucrative agreement
- encountering developed Personalities with whom you share a rich, eventful history, while trailing a vibrant diplomatic history of your own (storygen)
- launch caravans causing pawns to permanently leave to start new settlements at strategic locations in the region (storygen)


What do "factions" get up to:
(factions are networks of small groups of pawns)
Building Out a Network
  - roads
  - other? (power? leylines? magic? voidfibers?)
  - connected resources at individual settlements are somehow net positive across the network
    - let them easily produce far too much to store, so a single farming colony produces LOTS of export, instantly freeing the next 10 pawns in new colonies from sustenance work
    - not just food but all craftable things
  - what is money?
    - shared resource across all colonies
    - use money as the limiter gating on the tech tree and network build-out
    - they have to run successful businesses to make enough money to get ahead
    - vs Rimworld:
      - survival becomes easy (player chooses if someone dies)
      - attaining and maintaining next money tier is hard
      - "keeping pawns alive shall be easy, paying their wages, however..."

Questing
  - accepting/completing "quest" scenarios which emerge on the map periodically (add nodes to the network automatically after completing a small challenge there) storygen

Expansion
  - penetrating into the Outer Rim'lyeh with well-stocked supply lines
